## What Even *Is* a Waiver?

A waiver is a short, legally binding document your clients sign to acknowledge risks, give consent, or grant permission before a service.

Whether you're giving tattoos, leading a yoga class, or running a workshop — it protects both you *and* your clients.

## 3 Common Types of Waivers

- **Liability Waivers**  
  Release your business from legal responsibility if something goes wrong (e.g. injuries, allergic reactions).

- **Consent Forms**  
  Let clients agree to specific actions like procedures, bodywork, or new treatments.

- **Photo/Video Release**  
  Grant you permission to use photos or videos of clients for social media or marketing.

You can combine all three in one clean digital waiver — like Waivify does.

## What Happens If You Don’t Use One?

- Misunderstandings about risks or procedures  
- Legal exposure if something goes wrong  
- Trouble using content from your sessions  
- Bad optics if you’re caught unprepared

Bottom line: no waiver = no protection.

## Digital vs Paper Waivers

**Paper waivers** are easy to forget, lose, or misplace.  
**Digital waivers** are:

- Easy to send and sign before the session  
- Accessible on phone, tablet, or desktop  
- Securely stored, searchable, and timestamped

No clipboards. No printers. No last-minute scramble.
