## Train Hard. Stay Covered.

As a personal trainer, your focus is your client’s progress — not paperwork.

But whether you’re leading a bootcamp or working one-on-one, a signed waiver protects you from unexpected liability and keeps your workflow sharp.  
Waivify makes it simple, mobile-friendly, and fast.

## Why Personal Trainers Use Waivers

- **Liability coverage** for injuries or incidents  
- **Photo/video release** for before-and-after pics or social content  
- **Medical and fitness disclaimers**  
- **Consent for in-person or at-home sessions**

Even a single training session carries risk — waivers keep you covered and confident.

## Works Wherever You Train
