## See Every Signature, Live

Forget guessing whether someone signed their waiver.  
Waivifyâ€™s real-time dashboard shows you exactly whatâ€™s happening â€” as it happens.

## Real-Time Activity at a Glance

- New waiver submitted? âœ… It appears instantly.  
- Timestamped? âœ… Youâ€™ll see when it was signed.  
- Need to export it later? âœ… One click away.

Itâ€™s like having a digital filing cabinet that organizes itself.
