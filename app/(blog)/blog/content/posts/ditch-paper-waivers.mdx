## Paper Waivers Seem Simple — Until They’re Not

You print the waiver.  
They sign it.  
You file it (somewhere?).

But what happens when the form goes missing?  
Or the handwriting is unreadable?  
Or you need a timestamp… and there isn’t one?

## Paper = Risk

Here's what you’re risking with paper:

- **Lost or damaged forms**
- **Illegible handwriting or missing fields**
- **No built-in timestamps or digital trails**
- **Harder to prove compliance in a dispute**
- **No backup if you're audited or sued**

Whether you're running a yoga class, tattoo studio, or in-person workshop — paper puts you (and your clients) at legal and operational risk.
