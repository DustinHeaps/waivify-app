## Flow First. Signatures Second.

Yoga instructors create calm and clarity for their students — not chaos with paperwork at the door.

But whether you’re teaching vinyasa in a studio or leading sunrise sessions in the park, having a signed waiver in place is essential.  
Waivify makes the process seamless, mobile-friendly, and zero-stress.

## Why Yoga Instructors Use Waivers

- **Liability protection** in case of injuries  
- **Health disclosures** (e.g., pregnancy, injury, limitations)  
- **Photo release** for social sharing and marketing  
- **Consent to touch or adjust**

Even if your classes are casual — waivers keep you protected and professional.
