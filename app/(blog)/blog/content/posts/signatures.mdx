## Why Automate Waiver Collection?

If you’re running a tattoo studio, yoga class, or photography gig, collecting waivers manually slows things down. With Waivify + Zapier, you can:

- Automatically send waiver links to new clients
- Get notified instantly when someone signs
- Save all signed waivers in your system of choice

No more manual follow-up. Just fast, automated consent — every time.
