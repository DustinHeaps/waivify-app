## Ink First. Paperwork Second.

Tattoo shops thrive on artistry — not admin. But client waivers are non-negotiable for legal and safety reasons.

With Waivify, artists can collect legally binding signatures *without* printing a single page. It’s fast, mobile-friendly, and takes the pressure off your front desk.

## Why Tattoo Artists Use Waivers

- **Informed consent** for procedures  
- **Liability protection** in case of allergic reactions or aftercare issues  
- **Photo/video release** for sharing client work on social media  
- **Age verification** for minors (where applicable)

Waivers aren’t just legal cover — they’re part of a professional experience.

## How Digital Waivers Save Time

Old-school waivers mean stacks of paper, clipboards, and the “wait here and sign this” routine.

Waivify flips the script:

- Clients sign **before** they even sit down  
- No printing, scanning, or storage headaches  
- Everything is saved securely and searchable by name, date, or session

## Collect Signatures On iPad or Phone

Whether you're at a studio or working a tattoo convention, Waivify works on:

- iPad at the front desk  
- Your own iPhone or Android  
- A shared shop tablet  
- Or via a link you text or email before the appointment

Your client taps, signs, and they’re done — no app to install.

## Sync With Your Booking Flow

Using something like Calendly or Square Appointments?

You can automatically send waiver links **right after someone books**.  
They’ll show up with everything ready — no awkward “oh, can you sign this real quick?” moment.
