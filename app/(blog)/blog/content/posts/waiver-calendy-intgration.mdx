## Collect Waivers Before You Even Say Hello

Forget scrambling to get a waiver signed at the start of a call or in-person session.

With Waivify’s Calendly integration, signatures come in *before* the appointment even happens — automatically.

---

## Why Sync Waivers With Booking?

Every time someone books time with you, you’re taking on risk.  
If they show up and haven’t signed, it delays your workflow — or worse, puts you in a legal bind.

---

## How It Works

1. **Connect your Waivify waiver to your Calendly event**
2. **Someone books an appointment**
3. **They instantly receive your waiver link**
4. **Waivify tracks if/when they’ve signed**
5. **You walk into the meeting fully covered**

## Works for All Kinds of Appointments

- **Tattoo or piercing consultations**  
- **Yoga or personal training sessions**  
- **Health and wellness intakes**  
- **Workshops, coaching, or onboarding calls**  

If you use Calendly, you can collect a waiver — automatically.
