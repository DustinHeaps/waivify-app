## Yes — You Probably Need One

If you offer any service where a client shows up in-person, signs up for something physical, or participates in anything with risk — you should be using waivers.

Even if you’re a **solo business owner**. Even if you have insurance. Even if you've never had an issue before.

## Who Needs Waivers?

Here are just a few industries where waivers are *critical*:

- **Fitness and yoga instructors**  
- **Tattoo and piercing shops**  
- **Spas and wellness professionals**  
- **Photographers and videographers**  
- **Event organizers and workshop hosts**  
- **Coaches and bodyworkers**

If there’s any physical activity, close contact, or content release involved — you’re on the hook.

## Myth: “My Insurance Covers That”

A lot of small business owners believe their insurance will take care of everything.  
But here’s the reality:

- Insurance **requires** documentation (like waivers) to process claims  
- If a client sues, your waiver is your first line of defense  
- Verbal agreements mean nothing in court

Think of a waiver as a low-friction way to stay compliant and confident.

## When Verbal Isn’t Enough

You might trust your clients — but things go sideways all the time.

- Someone trips in your studio  
- A client claims they weren’t told about aftercare  
- A parent says they didn’t give permission

A signed waiver protects your business **and proves consent**.
